Additionally, remove any needs or effects related to the `sober` predicate, even though it doesn't appear in the actions provided. Here's the modified domain:\n\n1. **Removing `tires-ok` Predicate:**\n\n```diff\n- (define (domain driverlog)\n+ (define (domain driverlog)\n  (:requirements :typing :fluents) \n  (:types           location locatable - object\n        driver truck obj - locatable)\n\n  (:predicates \n        (at ?obj - locatable ?loc - location)\n        (in ?obj1 - obj ?obj - truck)\n        (driving ?d - driver ?v - truck)\n        (link ?x ?y - location)\n        (empty ?v - truck)\n  )\n  (:functions (time-to-walk ?l1 ?l2 - location)\n        (time-to-drive ?l1 ?l2 - location)\n        (driven)\n        (walked))\n```\n\n2. **Removing the `INFLATE-TIRES` Action:**\n\nSince there is no `INFLATE-TIRES` action provided in the initial domain, this step is inherently completed. No changes are necessary for this.\n\n3. **Ensuring No Effects or Preconditions Involve `tires-ok` or `sober`:**\n\nReview the actions and modify them to remove any preconditions or effects involving `tires-ok` or `sober`. Since the provided domain doesn't include such clauses for `sober`, this is inherently completed.\n\n4. **Reviewing the Domain Actions for Completeness:**\n\nEnsure the remaining actions are logically consistent without the `tires-ok` and `sober` predicates. The other actions should work independently. There may be improvements, but no removals necessary based on `sober`.\n\n5. **Final Modified Domain:**\n\nHere is the final cleaned-up PDDL domain:\n\n```lisp\n(define (domain driverlog)\n  (:requirements :typing :fluents) \n  (:types           location locatable - object\n        driver truck obj - locatable)\n\n  (:predicates \n        (at ?obj - locatable ?loc - location)\n        (in ?obj1 - obj ?obj - truck)\n        (driving ?d - driver ?v - truck)\n        (link ?x ?y - location)\n        (empty ?v - truck)\n  )\n  (:functions (time-to-walk ?l1 ?l2 - location)\n        (time-to-drive ?l1 ?l2 - location)\n        (driven)\n        (walked))\n\n  (:action LOAD-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n     (?obj - obj\n      ?truck - truck\n      ?loc - location)\n    :precondition\n     (and (at ?truck ?loc) (at ?obj ?loc))\n    :effect\n     (and (not (at ?obj ?loc)) (in ?obj ?truck)))\n\n  (:action UNLOAD-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n     (?obj - obj\n      ?truck - truck\n      ?loc - location)\n    :precondition\n     (and (at ?truck ?loc) (in ?obj ?truck))\n    :effect\n     (and (not (in ?obj ?truck)) (at ?obj ?loc)))\n\n  (:action BOARD-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n     (?driver - driver\n      ?truck - truck\n      ?loc - location)\n    :precondition\n     (and (at ?truck ?loc) (at ?driver ?loc) (empty ?truck))\n    :effect\n     (and (not (at ?driver ?loc)) (driving ?driver ?truck) (not (empty ?truck))))\n\n  (:action DISEMBARK-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n     (?driver - driver\n      ?truck - truck\n      ?loc - location)\n    :precondition\n     (and (at ?truck ?loc) (driving ?driver ?truck))\n    :effect\n     (and (not (driving ?driver ?truck)) (at ?driver ?loc) (empty ?truck)))\n\n  (:action DRIVE-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n     (?truck - truck\n      ?loc-from - location\n      ?loc-to - location\n      ?driver - driver)\n    :precondition\n     (and (at ?truck ?loc-from)\n     (driving ?driver ?truck) (link ?loc-from ?loc-to))\n    :effect\n     (and (not (at ?truck ?loc-from)) (at ?truck ?loc-to)\n            (increase (driven) (time-to-drive ?loc-from ?loc-to))))\n\n  (:action WALK\n    :parameters\n     (?driver - driver\n      ?loc-from - location\n      ?loc-to - location)\n    :precondition\n     (and (at ?driver ?loc-from))\n    :effect\n     (and (not (at ?driver ?loc-from)) (at ?driver ?loc-to)\n        (increase (walked) (time-to-walk ?loc-from ?loc-to))))\n\n\n)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the domain is free from `tires-ok` and `sober` predicate dependencies and does not include any action related to `INFLATE-TIRES`."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 751, "completion_tokens": 1137, "total_tokens": 1888}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}

They don\u2019t seem to require `driving` or `path` predicates as they are not directly related to driving or walking.\n\n2. **BOARD-TRUCK**: \n   - Preconditions already check if the truck is empty and the driver is at the same location as the truck.\n   - The `effect` already sets the `driving` predicate to true.\n\n3. **DISEMBARK-TRUCK**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the driver is currently driving the truck and the truck is at the specified location.\n   - The `effect` ensures that the `driving` predicate is set to false.\n\n4. **DRIVE-TRUCK**:\n   - Preconditions check if the driver is driving the truck and handle the linking of locations.\n   - No further changes are needed here.\n\n5. **WALK**:\n   - A precondition checks if there's a walkable path between locations, which uses the `path` predicate as intended.\n\n### Modified Domain\n\n```lisp\n(define (domain driverlog)\n  (:requirements :typing :durative-actions) \n  (:types\n    location locatable - object\n    driver truck obj - locatable)\n  \n  (:predicates \n    (at ?obj - locatable ?loc - location)\n    (in ?obj1 - obj ?obj - truck)\n    (driving ?d - driver ?v - truck)\n    (link ?x ?y - location) \n    (path ?x ?y - location)\n    (empty ?v - truck)\n  )\n\n  (:durative-action LOAD-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n      (?obj - obj ?truck - truck ?loc - location)\n    :duration (= ?duration 5)\n    :condition\n      (and \n        (over all (at ?truck ?loc)) \n        (at start (at ?obj ?loc)))\n    :effect\n      (and \n        (at start (not (at ?obj ?loc))) \n        (at end (in ?obj ?truck))))\n\n  (:durative-action UNLOAD-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n      (?obj - obj ?truck - truck ?loc - location)\n    :duration (= ?duration 5)\n    :condition\n      (and\n        (over all (at ?truck ?loc)) \n        (at start (in ?obj ?truck)))\n    :effect\n      (and \n        (at start (not (in ?obj ?truck))) \n        (at end (at ?obj ?loc))))\n\n  (:durative-action BOARD-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n      (?driver - driver ?truck - truck ?loc - location)\n    :duration (= ?duration 3)\n    :condition\n      (and \n        (over all (at ?truck ?loc)) \n        (at start (at ?driver ?loc)) \n        (at start (empty ?truck)))\n    :effect\n      (and \n        (at start (not (at ?driver ?loc))) \n        (at end (driving ?driver ?truck)) \n        (at start (not (empty ?truck)))))\n\n  (:durative-action DISEMBARK-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n      (?driver - driver ?truck - truck ?loc - location)\n    :duration (= ?duration 3)\n    :condition\n      (and \n        (over all (at ?truck ?loc)) \n        (at start (driving ?driver ?truck)))\n    :effect\n      (and \n        (at start (not (driving ?driver ?truck))) \n        (at end (at ?driver ?loc)) \n        (at end (empty ?truck))))\n\n  (:durative-action DRIVE-TRUCK\n    :parameters\n      (?truck - truck ?loc-from - location ?loc-to - location ?driver - driver)\n    :duration (= ?duration 20)\n    :condition\n      (and \n        (at start (at ?truck ?loc-from)) \n        (over all (driving ?driver ?truck)) \n        (at start (link ?loc-from ?loc-to)))\n    :effect\n      (and \n        (at start (not (at ?truck ?loc-from))) \n        (at end (at ?truck ?loc-to))))\n\n  (:durative-action WALK\n    :parameters\n      (?driver - driver ?loc-from - location ?loc-to - location)\n    :duration (= ?duration 30)\n    :condition\n      (and \n        (at start (at ?driver ?loc-from)) \n        (at start (path ?loc-from ?loc-to)))\n    :effect\n      (and \n        (at start (not (at ?driver ?loc-from))) \n        (at end (at ?driver ?loc-to))))\n\n)\n```\n\nThese changes incorporate the `driving` and `path` predicates appropriately into the existing domain actions without unnecessary modifications."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 874, "completion_tokens": 1134, "total_tokens": 2008}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}

The driver needs to be at the same location as the truck, and the truck must be empty (i.e., no driver currently driving). The effects are that the driver is no longer at the location but is driving the truck, and the truck is no longer empty.\n2. **DISEMBARK-TRUCK**: This action allows the driver to get out of the truck. The driver must be currently driving the truck, and the truck should be at a specific location. The effects are that the driver is at the location and is no longer driving the truck, making the truck empty.\n3. **LOAD-TRUCK**: This action puts an object into the truck. The truck and the object must be at the same location. The effect is that the object is no longer at the location but is inside the truck.\n4. **UNLOAD-TRUCK**: This action removes an object from the truck. The truck must be at a specific location, and the object must be inside the truck. The effect is that the object is now at the location, and no longer inside the truck.\n5. **WALK**: The pre-existing action for walking has been retained without modification.

Added the `driving` predicate in the `:predicates` section, which will track if a driver is in a driving position in a truck.\n2. Added the `path` predicate in the `:predicates` section to indicate if there is a walkable path between two locations.\n3. Updated the preconditions and effects of various actions accordingly:\n    - The `BOARD-TRUCK` action uses the `driving` predicate to set a driver as driving a truck.\n    - The `DISEMBARK-TRUCK` action uses the `driving` predicate to indicate that the driver stops driving.\n    - The `DRIVE-TRUCK` action includes the `driving` predicate in its preconditions to ensure that a truck can only be driven by a driver assigned to it.\n    - The `WALK` action uses the `path` predicate to indicate that walking is only possible if there is a walkable path between the specified locations."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 899, "completion_tokens": 1049, "total_tokens": 1948}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}

For each action that requires energy, added preconditions to check if the rover has enough energy.\n   - Added effects to decrease the rover's energy by the required amount when the action is performed.\n   - Added the `recharge` action to allow the rover to increase its energy by 20 units if it is in the sun and its current energy is 80 or less. Additionally, this action increments the `recharges` function by 1.\n\n3. **Consistency Across Actions:**\n   - Ensured that all actions involving energy consumption have corresponding checks and modifications in their preconditions and effects.\n\nThese changes ensure that the domain accurately models the energy management system alongside the other functionalities of the rover."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1485, "completion_tokens": 1839, "total_tokens": 3324}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}

For each action that requires a minimum energy level and consumes energy on execution (`navigate`, `sample_soil`, `sample_rock`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, `communicate_soil_data`, `communicate_rock_data`, `communicate_image_data`), the `:condition` is updated to check for the minimum required energy at the start.\n   - The `:effect` for each of these actions is updated to decrease the energy by the appropriate amount.\n   \n3. **Recharge** action:\n   - Added a new `recharge` durative action that calculates its duration based on the rover\u2019s current energy level and recharge rate. The action increases the rover's energy by the recharge rate multiplied by the duration. \n\nThese changes ensure that the energy constraints and recharging aspects are properly taken into account in the domain model."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1899, "completion_tokens": 2450, "total_tokens": 4349}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}

The preconditions and effects are divided into `at start`, `over all`, and `at end` clauses as appropriate for each action.\n4. The energy changes and other effects have been appropriately divided into either `at start` or `at end` clauses to reflect when they take place during the action's duration.\n5.
