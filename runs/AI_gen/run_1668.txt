Warnings encountered when parsing Domain/Problem File
-----------------------------------------------------

The supplied domain/problem file appear to violate part of the PDDL
language specification.  Specifically:

Errors: 0, warnings: 1
/home/god/Documents/Masters/data/IPC3/Tests1/DriverLog/Strips/AI_gen/DriverLog_St4_nl.pddl: line: 27: Warning: Undeclared requirement :negative-preconditions 

The planner will continue, but you may wish to fix your files accordingly
Number of literals: 153
Constructing lookup tables:A problem has been encountered, and the planner has to terminate.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, at present, the planner does not fully support ADL
unless in the rules for derived predicates.  Only two aspects of
ADL can be used in action definitions:
- forall conditions, containing a simple conjunct of propositional and
  numeric facts;
- Conditional (when... ) effects, and then only with numeric conditions
  and numeric consequences on values which do not appear in the
  preconditions of actions.

To use this planner with your problem, you will have to reformulate it to
avoid ADL.  Alternatively, if you have a particularly compelling case
for them, please contact the authors to discuss it with them, who may be able to
extend the planner to meet your needs.
