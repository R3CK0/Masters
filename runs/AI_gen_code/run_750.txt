The action (drive truck0 depot0 depot0) has a fixed duration of zero,
but also has:

* Propositional over all conditions

In this case, correct handling of the action is unclear (e.g. at what point
must the over all/at end conditions hold if there is no gap between the start
and end of the action).  If the intention is for the action to be truly
instantaneous, use a PDDL (:action rather than a (:durative-action.  For now,
however, the action has been discarded.

Other actions to have been discarded due to zero-durations include
(drive truck1 depot0 depot0)
