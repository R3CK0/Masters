Modify the following PDDL
Add the ability to Lift and Drop crates using the hoist, and to Load and Unload the truck with crates using the hoist

This will require adding 5 actions

The drive action moves the truck from start to finnish and has a duration of 10
The Load action loads the crate currently on the hoist into the truck, The unload does the opposite
The Lift action uses the hoist to lift a crate that is clear of a surface, Drop liberates the Hoist and places the crate on a clear surface
The lift and drop actions have a duration of 1. The load and Unload actions have a duration of 3 and 4 respectively
Using commonsense and the domain add the required elements think step by step
