Modify the following PDDL domain
add the ability to load and unload creates into the truck and for the truck to drive from one location to another

This will require adding 3 action
actions: Load Unload Drive

The Load action loads the crate currently on the hoist into the truck, The unload does the opposite and the drive action moves the truck from a to b. 
The drive action has a duration of distance/speed, the load and Unload a duration is equal to weight/power
Using commonsense and the domain add the required elements think step by step
