Modify the following PDDL
Add the ability to Lift and Drop crates using the hoist, and to Load and Unload the truck with crates using the hoist

This will require adding  4 actions


The Load action loads the crate currently on the hoist into the truck, The Unload action does the opposite
The Lift action uses the hoist to lift a crate that is clear of a surface, Drop renders the hoist available and places the crate being lifted on a clear surface
The Lift and Drop actions have a duration of 1, the Load action a duratioon of 3 and the Unload action 4
Using commonsense and the domain add the required elements think step by step
