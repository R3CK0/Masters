Modify the following PDDL
Add the ability to Lift and Drop crates using the hoist, and to Load and Unload the truck with crates using the hoist

This will require adding 3 functions, 4 actions and 1 predicates
functions: load_limit per truck, current_load per truck and weight per crate
predicate: lifting hoist lifts crate

The drive action costs 10 fuel and moves the truck from start to finnish
The Load action loads the crate currently on the hoist into the truck, The unload does the opposite
The Lift action uses the hoist to lift a crate that is clear of a surface and costs 1 fuel, Drop liberates the Hoist and places the crate on a clear surface
Using commonsense and the domain add the required elements think step by step
