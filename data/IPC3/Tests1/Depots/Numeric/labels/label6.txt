Modify the following PDDL domain
add the ability to load and unload creates into the truck and for the truck to drive from one location to another

This will require adding 3 functions, 3 actions and 1 predicates
functions: load_limit per truck, current_load per truck and weight per crate
predicate: in (crate in truck)

actions:
conditions: the hoist and the truck must be at the same place, the hoist must be lifting the crate and the load_limit must be less then the weight of the crate + the current_load of the truck
effect: the hoist will no longer be lifting the crate and will be available again, the crate will be in the truck and the current_load of the truck will increase by the weight of the crate

Unload
conditions: the hoist and the truck must be at the same place, the hoist must be available and the crate must be in the truck
effect: the crate will no longer be in the truck, the hoist will be lifting the crate and thus no longer be available and the current_load of the truck will decrease by the weight of the crate

Drive:
The drive action increases the fuel cost by 10 and moves the truck from one place to another
