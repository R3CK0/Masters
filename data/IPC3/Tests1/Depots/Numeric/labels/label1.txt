Modify the following PDDL domain by 
adding a load_limit to the truck. 

This will require adding 3 functions: 
load_limit per truck, current_load per truck and the weight per crate

The load action will have an extra predicate where the load_limit for the truck must be lower then the current_load + the weight of the crate
The effect will have the current_weight increased by the crate weight

The Unload action will add the effect to decrease the current_load by the weight
