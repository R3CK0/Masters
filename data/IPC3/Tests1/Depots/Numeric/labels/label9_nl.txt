Modify the following PDDL domain
Add the clear check to make sure a surface of an object is clear before trying to lift it or putting something on it

This will require adding 1 predicate and modifying 2 actions
predicate: clear surface, a surface can be a pallet or crate

Using common sense
Modify the lift and drop actions to include this condition
Think step by step
