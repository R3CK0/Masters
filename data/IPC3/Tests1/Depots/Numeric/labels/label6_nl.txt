Modify the following PDDL domain
add the ability to load and unload creates into the truck and for the truck to drive from one location to another

This will require adding 3 functions, 3 actions and 1 predicates
functions: load_limit per truck, current_load per truck and weight per crate
predicate: in (crate in truck)
actions: Load Unload Drive

The Load action loads the crate currently on the hoist into the truck, The unload does the opposite and the drive action moves the truck from a to b and costs 10 fuel. 
Using commonsense and the domain add the required elements think step by step
