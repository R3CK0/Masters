Modify the following PDDL
Add the ability to Lift and Drop crates using the hoist, and to Load and Unload the truck with crates using the hoist

This will require adding 3 functions, 4 actions and 1 predicates
functions: load_limit per truck, current_load per truck and weight per crate
predicate: lifting hoist lifts crate

actions:
conditions: the hoist and the truck must be at the same place, the hoist must be lifting the crate and the load_limit must be less then the weight of the crate + the current_load of the truck
effect: the hoist will no longer be lifting the crate and will be available again, the crate will be in the truck and the current_load of the truck will increase by the weight of the crate

Unload
conditions: the hoist and the truck must be at the same place, the hoist must be available and the crate must be in the truck
effect: the crate will no longer be in the truck, the hoist will be lifting the crate and thus no longer be available and the current_load of the truck will decrease by the weight of the crate

Lift
Condition: The Hoist, if available lifts a crate if both are at the same place, for the hoist to lift the crate, the crate must be clear and on a surface
Effect: Lifting the crate off the surface will leave it clear, the crate will no longer be clear since it's in the air, 
the hoist lifting the crate with no longer be available, the crate is no longer at the same place as the hoist, lifting increases the fuel-cost by 1

Drop 
Condition: the hoist drops the crate at the same place as the surface, the surface and the hoist must be at the same place, the hoist can only drop a crate on a clear surface
Effect : The surface will no longer be clear after dropping the crate on it, the hoist becomes available again, the crate will be clear in case other crates need to be stacked on top
