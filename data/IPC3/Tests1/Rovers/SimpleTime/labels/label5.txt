Modify the following PDDL domain
add sample-soil, sample-rock, communicate_rock_data, communicate_soil_data and calibrate actions and equipped_for_soil_analysis, equipped_for_rock_analysis, calibrated, have_soil_analysis, have_rock_analysis, communicated_rock_data, communicate_soil_data predicates

This requires adding 5 action and 7 predicate
predicate: equipped_for_soil_analysis per rover, equipped_for_rock_analysis per rover, calibrated per camera per rover, have_soil_analysis per rover per waypoint, have_rock_analysis per rover per waypoint and communicated_rock_data per waypoint
action: sample-soil, sample-rock, calibrate, communicate_rock_data, communicate_soil_daata

sample-soil:
parameters: rover store waypoint
duration: 10
conditions: rover is at waypoint, the soil sample is at waypoint, the rover is equipped for soil analysis and has a store that is empty
effect: store is no longer empty, it's full, the rover has the soil analysis and the soil sample is no longer at the waypoint

sample-rock:
parameters: rover store waypoint
duration: 8
conditions: rover is at waypoint, the rock sample is at waypoint, the rover is equipped for rock analysis and has a store that is empty
effect: store is no longer empty, it's full, the rover has the rock analysis and the rock sample is no longer at the waypoint

calibrate:
parameters: rover camera objective waypoint
duration: 5
conditions: rover must be equipped for imaging, the objective must be a calibration target for the camera, the rover must be at the waypoint and the objective
 must be visible from the waypoint, the camera must be on board the rover
effect: camera on the rover is calibrated

communicate_rock_data:
parameters: rover lander waypoint waypoint waypoint
duration: 10
conditions: rover is at a waypoint, lander is at a waypoint, the rover waypoint and lander waypoint are in visible range, 
the rover has the rock analysis from the waypoint where it took sample the rover is available and the communication channel is free
effect: rover is temporarily unavailable, channel is temporarily not free, rover becomes available again, channel becomes free

communicate_soil_data:
parameters: rover lander waypoint waypoint waypoint
duration: 10
conditions: rover is at a waypoint, lander is at a waypoint, the rover waypoint and lander waypoint are in visible range, 
the rover has the soil analysis from the waypoint where it took sample the rover is available and the communication channel is free
effect: rover is temporarily unavailable, channel is temporarily not free, rover becomes available again, channel becomes free
