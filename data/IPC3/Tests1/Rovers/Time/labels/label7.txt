Modify the following PDDL domain
add recharge-rate and energy function and recharge action

This will require to add one function and 1 action and modify 8 actions
function: recharge-rate specifies the recharge rate of rover
durative-action: recharge

recharge:
parameters: rover waypoint
duration: (80-(rover current energy))/(rover recharge-rate)
condition: rover must be at waypoint and stay there over all the recharge process, the waypoint must be in_sun, the rover must have a maximum of 80 energy to start recharging
effect: increase the rover energy by recharge-rate * duration

the following actions require a minimum of energy to be performed and consume that amount when completed
navigate: 8
sample_soil: 3
sample_rock: 5
calibrate: 2
take_image: 1
communicate_soil_data: 4
communicate_rock_data: 4
communicate_image_data: 6
