Modify the following PDDL domain
add sample-soil, sample-rock actions and equipped_for_soil_analysis, equipped_for_rock_analysis predicates

This requires adding 2 action and 2 predicate
predicate: equipped_for_soil_analysis per rover, equipped_for_rock_analysis per rover
action: sample-soil, sample-rock

sample-soil:
parameters: rover store waypoint
duration: 10
conditions: rover is at waypoint, the soil sample is at waypoint, the rover is equipped for soil analysis and has a store that is empty, the rover has a minimum of 3 energy
effect: store is no longer empty, it's full, the rover has the soil analysis and the soil sample is no longer at the waypoint, the rover's energy decreases by 3

sample-rock:
parameters: rover store waypoint
duration: 8
conditions: rover is at waypoint, the rock sample is at waypoint, the rover is equipped for rock analysis and has a store that is empty, the rover has a minimum of 5 energy
effect: store is no longer empty, it's full, the rover has the rock analysis and the rock sample is no longer at the waypoint, the rover's energy decreases by 3
