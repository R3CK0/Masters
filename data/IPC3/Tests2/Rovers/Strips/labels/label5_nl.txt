Modify the following PDDL domain
add sample-soil, sample-rock, communicate_rock_data, communicate_soil_data and calibrate actions and equipped_for_soil_analysis, equipped_for_rock_analysis, calibrated, have_soil_analysis, have_rock_analysis, communicated_rock_data, communicate_soil_data predicates

context: the at_*_sample predicate indicates if a sample is at a waypoint, the equipped_for_*_analysis indicates if a rover is equipped for a specific type of analysis, 
store_of indicates if a rover is equipped with the specified storage, empty is to qualify a storage of empty, full qualifies a storage as full, a storage can either be full or empty,
have_*_analysis indicates if a rover posseses a sample of a the * type, 
the calibration_target predicate indicates the camera objective, visible_from predicate indicates if the objective is visible from a waypoint, 
on_board predicate indicates if camera is on rover. The calibrated predicate indicates that the camera has been calibrated to objective and is ready to take_image.
at_lander predicate indicates that a lander is at a waypoint, available indicates that the rover is available to communicate data or navigate, channel_free indicates if the lander
is available to communicate, communicated_*_data, indicates that the rover communicated data of * type
