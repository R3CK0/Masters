Modify the following PDDL domain
Add the recharge action, the recharges and energy function and in_sun predicate

This requires adding 1 action and 2 function and 1 predicate and modify most actions
predicate: in_sun per waypoint
function: recharges tracks the amount of recharges done 
action: recharge

recharge:
parameters: rover waypoint
conditions: rover is at waypoint, waypoint is in the sun, energy is less or equal to 80
effect: increase energy of rover by 20, increases recharges by 1

some actions need a minimum of energy to execute and their execution consumes that energy
navigate: 8
sample_soil: 3
sample_rock: 5
drop: none
calibrate: 2
take_image: 1
communicate_soil_data: 4
communicate_rock_data: 4
communicate_image_data: 6
